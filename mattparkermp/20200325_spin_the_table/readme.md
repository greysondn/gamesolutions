Given a table of 7 people, find a configuration where you can set number packets
in order on the table and yet not have any matches to people sitting at seats by
rotation of the table itself.

Imagine the table as a list. Imagine the place settings as a list. If they both
matched perfectly, it would look like this:

```
Table:  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
People: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
```
The people cannot be rotated, and the people may sit in random order. The table
can be rotated, however.
