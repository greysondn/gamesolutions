Provisioners have to actually travel from location to location ingame. This aims to find the minimum distance given the entire circuit of all locations. Both Commonwealth and Island.

There exist other maps, but a general solution to the problem has merits besides. If it were just as easy as plugging the data in and being patient, a lot such problems would likely get solved - and I'm not ruling out wanting the same data in Fallout 5, for example.

Also, and this is to the point - we've not proven the other maps are optimal yet, to the best of my knowledge.
