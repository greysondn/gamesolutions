Cynical Solution
----------------
I was unable to solve this myself, so some research got me to [skullheart user 
"Cynical"'s solution][SH-Cynical].

```
Main:
[1][1][2][1]
[2][J][L][1]
[J][2][2][2]

Func 1:
[F][F][J][L]
[C][0][0][0]

Func 2:
[F][F][R][J]
[F][F][C][L]
```

You know what? I was trying to do them in the opposite order :O
