-- In-game Description:
-- For each two things in the

-- You got a new command!
-- SUBtracts the contents of a tile
-- on the floor FROM whatever

    -- let's say that has the form of in(a, b)
    --                                out c (where c = b - a)
    --                                out d (where d = a - b)
start:
    -- in(a, b)
    INBOX        -- in a
    COPYTO   0   -- store a in 0
    INBOX        -- in b
    COPYTO   1   -- store b in 0
    -- out c
    SUB      0 -- hands now have c (b - a)
    OUTBOX     -- out c
    -- out d
    COPYFROM 0 -- put a in hands
    SUB      1 -- hands now have d (a - b)
    OUTBOX     -- out d
    -- repeat
    JUMP     start

    -- This one stumped me, I recall, because I wanted to solve it as
    -- an in-place swap. I couldn't solve it that way, which makes me
    -- sad, but I did get a double-optimized solution, which is always
    -- good, at least in terms of the game.
    --
    -- Astute observers will notice that my desired solution is
    -- impossible because your hands empty on output.
