## Human Resource Machine

Some very quick notes here on format and commands for those who want to read these without the game.


Human Resource Machine allows you to copy and paste its code. When you paste out code, you get something like the files in this repository. For example, my original level 1 solution ran like this:


```
-- HUMAN RESOURCE MACHINE PROGRAM --

    INBOX
    OUTBOX
    INBOX
    OUTBOX
    INBOX
    OUTBOX
```

Not very exciting, but a template for the format. It gets more complex as you go along. Like any good game or code probably should.

The language appears to be turing complete, granting that input is out of the user's control and instead only a function's implementation is left to the user in each stage. I actually greatly enjoy this, even if I'm not very good at it. But here, have some code documentation.

## Language Documentation

This format could be better.




### `--`
Command:  

```
--
```

Example:

```
-- I guess somebody liked lua?
```


Ingame Documentation:  

```
None?
```

Notes:

```
Seems to be a traditional line comment. Discarded on import back into game. Comment runs from the double-hyphen to the end of the line. This syntax is similar to Lua, if memory serves.
```

### `INBOX`

Command:  

```
INBOX
```

Example:

```
INBOX
```


Ingame Documentation:  

```
Inbox:
Pick up the next thing
from the INBOX
```

Notes:

```
Picks up one thing and puts it in your
pathetic human hands.
```

Eh, I'm lazy, I'll finish this later. Or never. Who cares?
